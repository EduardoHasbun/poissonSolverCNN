test_11 = Working model with domain 5.0, bound_weight: 5.0e+8, lapl_weight: 2.0e+6, optimizer_lr: 5.e-3 THIS CONFIGURATION WORKS




interface_1: Domain 5.0, radius 1.5, epsilon_inside 1.0, epsilon_outside 80, data / ratio, without interface_loss
interface_2: Same as before, less optimizer and more weight in loss
interface_3: Domain 5.0, radius 1.5, epsilon in 1.0, epsilon outside 80, normal data
interface_4: WIthout epsilon in the laplacian but in the input data, also inputdata with ratio
