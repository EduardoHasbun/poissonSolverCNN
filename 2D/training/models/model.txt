train_12 = Same as test_10, with greater value of optimizer and 150 epochs
train_13 = Same as test_12 but with ratio in dataset
train_13_1 = Same as 13 but without ratio in the data
test_13_2 = Same a 13 but with dataset scaled * 100
test_14 = Same as 13_2 but with dataset divided by ratio max

interface_1: Domain 5.0, radius 1.5, epsilon_inside 1.0, epsilon_outside 80, data / ratio, without interface_loss
interface_2: Same as before, less optimizer and more weight in loss
interface_3: Domain 5.0, radius 1.5, epsilon in 1.0, epsilon outside 80, normal data
interface_4: WIthout epsilon in the laplacian but in the input data, also inputdata with ratio
